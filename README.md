# StopForumSpam
is a nice service from http://www.stopforumspam.com/
this is a little helper to incorporate the daily created csv-database to this application (into a db). And then make it query via CLI.
You can install it on your shared server and let all your projects use it.
That will help to stop spamming the stopforumspam API :)
